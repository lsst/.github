## Rubin Observatory's GitHub Org map

[Rubin Observatory's](https://rubinobservatory.org/) mission is to carry out the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). 

This is our main Github org containing the repositories that are likely of most interest to our scientific community, regardless of which team authored them. 

As a fanatically open-source project, we have a number of additional GitHub orgs containing code for our internal systems.
